          <h2>The Importance of Banks</h2>
          <p>
            Banks are essential for the economy because they facilitate the flow of money and credit, which is crucial for economic growth. They help individuals save and invest their money, provide businesses with the capital they need to grow, and ensure the efficient operation of payment systems.
